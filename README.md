This repository demonstrates the use of various machine learning algorithms to classify non-linearly separable data. The dataset used is a variation of the "Moons" dataset, generated using `Scikit-learn`. Several models are implemented and their performance is compared. The models used include:

- Decision Tree
- Kernel SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Linear SVM
- Random Forest
- Bagging with SVM
